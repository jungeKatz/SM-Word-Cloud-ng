# SM-Word-Cloud-ng
This repository is based on Angular and It aims to prepare a dashboard that will be able to predict bias 
of social media profile. The project is aimed to have different analytics based graphs which will make visualitzation easy for the user to look and understand the bias.This repository is part of the project [Python Media Bias Learner ](https://github.com/jungeKatz?tab=projects "link to project"), which aims to provide a ML model that can study social media profiles and analyze them.
 * In the  project [Python Media Bias Learner ](https://github.com/jungeKatz?tab=projects "link to project") we have 3 basic modules
 1. The UI part that is the angular part of the project and is on github at  [SM-Word-Cloud-ng](https://github.com/jungeKatz/SM-Word-Cloud-ng "SM word cloud"). 
 2. The second part is going to be the node part of the project which is going to provide our angular with api and REST api connections to social media etc to show the feed of the project, the node repository can be found on github at [Word-Cloud-nodeService](https://github.com/jungeKatz/Word-Cloud-nodeService "node service").
 3. The third part of the project is the python part that will be used for analysing the social media profile posts and telling the bias [Python-analysis-service](https://github.com/jungeKatz/Python-analysis-service "python engine").

Aditionally I Will also try to implement docker and will keep on updating this README as the project proceeds further.
